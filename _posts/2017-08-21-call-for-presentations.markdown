On behalf of the programme committee it is my pleasure to extend an invitation to any interested speakers to submit a proposal for a presentation.

The conference will be held at LBL, Berkeley, CA USA, from the Wednesday the 18th to Friday the 20th of October 2017.

Presentations will be split into two main streams, one per day:

* The Strategic and Operational Stream will take place on Thursday. The focus will be on the operational advantages of SDN and Faucet. 
* The Technical and Development Stream will take place on Friday. This will examine some of the technical challenges of SDN development and how Faucet is approaching them. 

If you would like to give a presentation please submit your proposal to [cfp@faucet.nz](mailto:cfp@faucet.nz).

We look forward to hearing from you!
