The first FAUCET conference and (and second FAUCET PlugFest) will be held at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 18 to 20 October 2017.

#### Presentations will be split into two main streams

* The Strategic and Operational Stream will take place on Thursday. The focus will be on the operational advantages of SDN and FAUCET . This will feature a keynote presentation from Brad Cowie of The University of Waikato on their multi-vendor FAUCET deployment.

* The Technical and Development Stream will take place on Friday. This will examine some of the technical challenges of SDN development and how FAUCET is approaching them.

#### In addition to the main presentation streams there will be the following sessions

* A FAUCET PlugFest will be held on Wednesday. Vendors will be invited to test their hardware for interoperability and compatibility. The PlugFest network will remain in place for the main conference so attendees will have the opportunity to see it in action.

* There will be a live coding tutorial demonstrating the deployment of a FAUCET network from scratch on Thursday.

* Friday will also feature lightning talks and a developer workshop.
